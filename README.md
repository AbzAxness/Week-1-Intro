# Week 1: Introduction to Git, GitHub and RStudio


## Goals
This week you will be introduced to the course and learn how to use Git and GitHub with RStudio, as these are fundamental tools for version control and collaboration for data scientists. You will learn how to create your own GitHub repositories, write some code locally and practice committing and pushing your changes to GitHub, and practice collaborating with others via issues and pull requests.

## Resources
In addition to this week's lesson content, here are some useful and recommended resources for getting started with coding in R:
- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) (second edition)
- [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html)
- [RStudio Education](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/): Lots of useful links for beginners on this page
- [Interactive tutorials from Posit (formerly RStudio)](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers): These tutorials were made using the `learnr` package and allow you to run R code directly from your browser


## Material/Assignment
Start with the [intro-basics](https://github.com/Env-Data-Sci-FA23/Week-1-Intro/blob/main/lessons/intro-basics.md) lesson, follow the instructions to create a GitHub repository and finish working through the lesson, and commit and push your changes to your GitHub repository when you're done.

This week you will be graded on:

- Creating your own GitHub repository, pushing some local code, and submitting and reviewing a pull request for a classmate.

**To complete this week's assignment go to the [Issues](https://github.com/Env-Data-Sci-FA23/Week-1-Intro/issues) for this repository and add the link to the repo you made on your personal GitHub account. We will check to see that you successfully pushed some local code to GitHub.**

**Due: End of the day Fri 10/20**
